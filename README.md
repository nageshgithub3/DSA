# 🚀 15 Days Coding Challenge – DSA Practice

Welcome to my **15 Days Coding Challenge** inspired by [@digg_deeperr](https://www.instagram.com/digg_deeperr/).  
For 15 consecutive days, I’ll solve and upload **3 Data Structures & Algorithms problems daily**, with the goal of becoming more consistent and sharper at problem-solving.

## 📌 Problems Folder Structure

Each folder is named after the problem's ID and title (LeetCode-style), and contains clean, well-documented Java solutions.
